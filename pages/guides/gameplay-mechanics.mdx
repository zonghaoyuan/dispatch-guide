# Gameplay Mechanics

## Core Gameplay Loop

Dispatch revolves around three main gameplay pillars:

1. **Narrative Choices**: Dialogue and decision-making that shapes the story
2. **Strategic Dispatch**: Assigning heroes to emergencies based on their abilities
3. **Character Management**: Leveling up heroes and managing team dynamics

## The Dispatch System

### How Dispatching Works

The dispatch system is the core mechanic of Dispatch. When emergencies occur, you must:

1. **Analyze the Mission**: Each call displays required stats and mission tags
2. **Select Heroes**: Choose 1-3 heroes whose stats match the mission requirements
3. **Check Success Probability**: The game compares hero stats to hidden mission requirements
4. **Deploy**: Send your team and watch the results unfold

### Success Mechanics

Mission success is determined by:
- **Stat Matching**: How well hero stats align with mission requirements
- **Ability Synergy**: Heroes with abilities matching mission tags get bonuses
- **Team Chemistry**: Positive relationships boost performance
- **Fatigue Levels**: Fresh heroes perform better than exhausted ones
- **Hero Conditions**: Injuries and debuffs reduce effectiveness

### Visual Feedback

The dispatch interface shows overlapping stat charts:
- If the hero's stat profile overlaps with the mission requirements, it succeeds
- If there's no overlap, the mission fails
- Larger overlap areas indicate higher success probability

## Hero Management

### Leveling System

Heroes gain experience from missions and level up over time:

1. **Earn XP**: Heroes gain experience from completing missions
2. **Level Up**: Accumulated XP triggers level-ups
3. **Allocate Points**: Spend points to upgrade stats (Combat, Intellect, Charisma, Mobility, Vigor)
4. **Unlock Abilities**: Some heroes gain new abilities at certain levels

### Special XP Mechanics

- **Invisigal's Wolf Pack**: When Invisigal is dispatched solo, she doubles XP rewards for the entire team
- **Successful Missions**: Higher success rates provide more XP
- **Mission Difficulty**: Harder missions reward more experience

### Hero Database

Access the Hero Database (folder icon on the map) to:
- View hero stats and abilities
- Upgrade heroes after leveling up
- Check relationships and team chemistry
- Review hero backstories and flaws

## Cooldown and Fatigue System

### Cooldowns

After completing a mission, heroes enter a cooldown period where:
- They cannot be immediately redeployed
- Cooldown duration varies by mission intensity
- You must rotate your roster strategically

### Fatigue Management

Hero fatigue affects performance:
- **Fresh (0-40% fatigue)**: Optimal performance
- **Tired (40-70% fatigue)**: Slight performance decrease
- **Exhausted (70-100% fatigue)**: Significant performance penalties

**Best Practices**:
- Rest heroes after 2-3 consecutive missions
- Rotate team members to prevent exhaustion
- Avoid deploying exhausted heroes to critical missions

## Mission Types

## Quick Time Events (QTEs)

### What Are QTEs?

Quick Time Events are timed button-press sequences that occur during:
- Combat sequences
- Chase scenes
- Critical decision moments
- Hacking attempts

### QTE Mechanics

- **Button Prompts**: Press the correct button when prompted
- **Timing**: Some QTEs require precise timing
- **Consequences**: Success or failure affects mission outcomes and narrative
- **Stat Influence**: Hero stats can make QTEs easier or provide second chances

### QTE Tips

- Stay focused during action sequences
- Higher hero stats reduce QTE difficulty
- Some QTEs are optional but provide bonuses
- Failed QTEs don't always mean mission failure but may have consequences

## Hacking Mini-Games

### How Hacking Works

Certain missions involve hacking sequences:

1. **Path Navigation**: Navigate through data pathways
2. **Timed Inputs**: Enter codes or commands within time limits
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify and follow correct sequences
4. **Obstacle Avoidance**: Navigate around security measures

### Hacking Success Factors

- **Intellect Stat**: Higher Intellect makes hacking easier
- **Hero Abilities**: Some heroes have hacking-specific bonuses
- **Time Management**: Complete sequences before timers expire
- **Precision**: Accurate inputs prevent failures

### Hacking Benefits

Successful hacks can:
- Unlock additional information
- Disable threats
- Provide mission advantages
- Reveal story details

## Choice and Consequence System

## Office Interactions

Between missions, you'll interact with:
- **Team Members**: Build relationships through conversations
- **Blonde Blazer**: Your boss and SDN branch head

- Affect team morale
- Provide comic relief
- Set up future story developments

## Mission Scheduling

### Simultaneous Emergencies

As the game progresses:
- Multiple emergencies occur at once
- You must prioritize which to handle
- Some missions are time-sensitive
- Choosing one mission may mean failing others

### Priority Management

Consider:
- **Mission Difficulty**: Can your available heroes handle it?
- **Consequences**: What happens if this mission fails?
- **Hero Availability**: Who's on cooldown?
- **Story Impact**: Does this mission advance key storylines?

## Performance Tracking

The game tracks your performance:
- **Success Rate**: Percentage of successful missions
- **Perfect Runs**: Completing all missions without failures
- **Relationship Scores**: Team chemistry levels
- **Story Choices**: Major decisions made

High performance unlocks:
- Better endings

## Tips for Mastering Core Mechanics

1. **Study Mission Requirements**: Always check what stats are needed before deploying
2. **Balance Your Roster**: Don't over-rely on the same heroes
3. **Manage Fatigue**: Keep heroes fresh for critical missions
4. **Build Relationships**: Positive team chemistry improves success rates
5. **Save Specialization**: Deploy specialists to their optimal mission types
6. **Learn From Failures**: Failed missions provide learning opportunities
7. **Plan Ahead**: Anticipate cooldowns and rotate heroes strategically
8. **Pay Attention to Story**: Narrative choices matter as much as tactical ones

Understanding these core mechanics is essential for mastering Dispatch and achieving the best possible outcomes for Robert and his team.
