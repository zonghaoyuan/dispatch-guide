## Advanced Gameplay Tips

### XP Farming and Leveling

**Invisigal Wolf Pack Strategy**:
- Deploy Invisigal solo on low-risk combat missions
- Wolf Pack ability doubles XP for entire team
- Best during Episodes 3-4 when many missions available
- Focus on Combat 3-4 missions for guaranteed success
- Can level entire team 2-3 levels per episode using this method

**Efficient XP Distribution**:
- Don't spread XP too thin early game
- Focus on 3-4 core heroes in Episodes 1-2
- Expand to 6 heroes by Episode 3
- Full 8-10 hero roster by Episode 5
- Under-leveled heroes catch up faster (XP scaling)

**Level-Up Timing**:
- Level up before difficult episodes (3, 5, 7)
- Farm XP between major story missions
- Use downtime in Episodes 2 and 4 for farming
- Don't over-level too early (diminishing returns)

### Perfect Mission Success Strategies

**The 90% Rule**:
- Only deploy when simulator shows 90%+ success rate
- For perfect runs, consider 95%+ minimum
- Lower percentages acceptable only for low-priority missions
- If below 90%, add more heroes or choose different team

**Stat Padding**:
- When mission requires Combat 4, deploy Combat 5-6
- Extra stat points provide buffer against RNG
- Over-deploy (3 heroes instead of 2) when uncertain
- "Good enough" = 70%, "Safe" = 80%, "Perfect" = 90%+

**Simulator Mastery**:
- Test every team combination before deploying
- Swap hero positions to see duplication effects
- Check how relationships affect success rate
- Verify ability synergies are active
- Never skip simulator verification

### Cooldown Manipulation

**Strategic Cooldown Management**:
- Deploy heroes to easy missions first (shorter cooldown)
- Save for hard missions after they return
- Use Phenomenon (2-second cooldown) for filler missions
- Plan 2-3 missions ahead for rotation
- Keep emergency reserve hero always rested

**Cooldown Priority System**:
1. **Tier 1 Heroes** (Invisigal, Prism, Malevola): Use for medium-hard missions
2. **Tier 2 Heroes** (Punch Up, Coupe, Golem): Use for easy-medium missions
3. **Tier 3 Heroes** (Phenomenon, others): Spam for easy missions
4. **Emergency Reserve**: Keep one strong hero always available

**The Wave Strategy**:
- Deploy heroes in waves based on cooldown timing
- Wave 1: Initial missions (Heroes A, B, C)
- Wave 2: Next set after Wave 1 on cooldown (Heroes D, E, F)
- Wave 3: Emergency response (Heroes G, H)
- Wave 1 returns: Cycle repeats

### Relationship Optimization

**Power Pairs** (Build These Relationships):
- **Prism + Malevola**: Charisma/Intellect combo (+15% bonus)
- **Invisigal + Punch Up**: Combat specialists (+12% bonus)
- **Coupe + Golem**: Speed/Tank synergy (+10% bonus)
- **Sonar + Malevola**: Support synergy (+10% bonus)

**Relationship Building Fast Track**:
1. Deploy pairs together on 3-5 missions
2. Succeed at missions together (failures hurt relationships)
3. Choose supportive dialogue in office interactions
4. Avoid pairing rivals until relationship improves
5. Check relationship scores in hero database regularly

**Avoiding Negative Relationships**:
- Some heroes naturally conflict (check database)
- Don't force incompatible pairs together
- Failed missions together damage relationships
- Negative dialogue choices hurt team chemistry
- Can repair relationships but takes time and successful missions

### Resource Management

**Stat Point Allocation Strategy**:
- **Never spread too thin**: Focus heroes on 2-3 stats max
- **Specialists over generalists**: 3:1 ratio
- **Primary stat priority**: Get to 5 before touching others
- **Secondary stat timing**: Upgrade after primary hits 5-6
- **Ignore dump stats**: Accept weaknesses

**Upgrade Priority Order**:
1. **Episodes 1-2**: Primary stat to 4-5 on core 3 heroes
2. **Episodes 3-4**: Primary stat to 5-6 on core 6 heroes
3. **Episodes 5-6**: Secondary stats to 3-4, primary to 6+
4. **Episodes 7-8**: Optimization and min-maxing

**Hero Investment Priority**:
- **Must Invest**: Invisigal, Prism, Malevola (always useful)
- **High Priority**: Punch Up, Coupe (strong specialists)
- **Medium Priority**: Golem, Sonar (situational)
- **Low Priority**: Phenomenon, others (niche roles)

### Mission Prioritization Matrix

When facing simultaneous emergencies, use this priority system:

**Tier 1 - Immediate Priority**:
- Civilian casualties (multiple lives at risk)
- Story-critical missions (marked with special icons)
- Time-limited missions (will expire)
- High-consequence failures (cascading effects)

**Tier 2 - Important but Manageable**:
- Property damage situations
- Single civilian at risk
- Standard villain encounters
- Moderate consequence missions

**Tier 3 - Optional/Strategic Failure**:
- Minor crimes
- Low-risk situations
- Minimal consequence failures
- Can be sacrificed if heroes unavailable

**Decision Framework**:
1. Identify tier of each mission
2. Count available heroes
3. Match heroes to highest-tier missions first
4. Accept failure on lowest-tier if insufficient heroes
5. Deploy Phenomenon to quick tier-3 missions if available

### Advanced Combat Tactics

**QTE Optimization**:
- Higher Combat stat = easier QTE prompts
- Some QTEs can be failed strategically (minor consequences)
- Critical QTEs indicated by visual cues (focus here)
- Practice makes perfect (timing becomes intuitive)
- Failed QTEs don't always mean mission failure

**Hacking Mini-Game Mastery**:
- High Intellect makes paths more obvious
- Time limits less strict with Intellect 5+
- Some hacks have multiple solution paths
- Failed hacks may have second chance opportunities
- Deploy Intellect 5+ heroes to hacking missions for easy wins

**Tank and Healer Strategy**:
- Deploy Punch Up + Sonar for maximum survivability
- Use on unknown danger missions
- Excellent for first-time mission types
- Prevents hero casualties
- Slower but safer completion

### Story and Choice Optimization

**Romance Path Planning**:
- **Decide by Episode 2**: Know which ending you want
- **Build relationship early**: Episodes 1-2 interactions matter
- **Episode 3 choice is permanent**: Cannot change after
- **Continue nurturing**: Relationship needs maintenance Episodes 4-8
- **Alternative playthroughs**: Try different romances for other endings

**Leadership Style Consistency**:
- **Pick a style**: Authoritative, collaborative, or balanced
- **Stay consistent**: Contradictory choices confuse team
- **Affects team morale**: Consistency builds trust
- **Ending impact**: Leadership style affects Unity vs Solo endings
- **Can evolve gradually**: Slight changes acceptable

**Identity Management**:
- **Episode 6 decision matters**: Reveal or keep secret
- **Consider team dynamics**: How will revelation affect heroes?
- **Public perception**: Affects civilian support
- **Ending paths**: Determines Reveal vs Secret Keeper endings
- **Long-term consequences**: Affects Episodes 7-8 heavily

### Efficiency and Speed Strategies

**Fast Completion**:
- **Mobility 5+ heroes**: Invisigal, Coupe
- **Solo missions**: Faster than team deployments
- **Phenomenon spam**: Use 2-second cooldown
- **Skip optional dialogue**: Focus on critical choices
- **Simulator quickly**: Learn to recognize good comps fast

**Episode Time Management**:
- **Episodes 1-2**: 2-3 hours each (tutorial pace)
- **Episodes 3-4**: 3-4 hours each (complexity increase)
- **Episodes 5-6**: 4-5 hours each (high difficulty)
- **Episodes 7-8**: 3-4 hours each (narrative focus)
- **Total playtime**: 25-35 hours for full game

**Speedrun Strategies**:
- Focus on Invisigal Wolf Pack XP farming early
- Build only essential heroes (6 core heroes)
- Skip optional missions
- Optimize dialogue choices (pre-plan decisions)
- Master simulator quick-reading
- Accept some mission failures strategically

### Common Traps and How to Avoid Them

**Trap 1: Over-Investing in One Hero**:

- **Solution**: Respec if possible, specialize future upgrades
- **Prevention**: Follow specialist build guides

**Trap 5: Wrong Romance Choice**:
- **Problem**: Chose romance for gameplay reasons, want different ending
- **Solution**: Replay from Episode 3 save or new playthrough
- **Prevention**: Research endings before Episode 3 decision

**Trap 6: Neglecting Episode 6 Identity Choice**:
- **Problem**: Made casual choice, locked out of preferred ending
- **Solution**: Replay from Episode 6 or new playthrough
- **Prevention**: Understand ending requirements before Episode 6

- **Support**: 2-5-6-2-3 (Int-Charisma-Vigor focus)
- **Speedster**: 5-3-1-6-1 (Combat-Mobility focus)

**Optimal Roster Composition**:
- **2 Combat Specialists**: Invisigal, Coupe
- **2 Intellect Specialists**: Malevola, Prism
- **2 Charisma Specialists**: Prism, Sonar
- **2 Tanks**: Punch Up, Golem
- **1 Flex**: Phenomenon or situational hero
