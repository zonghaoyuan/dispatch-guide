- **3**: Above Average - Competent and reliable
- **4**: Excellent - Among the best in this area
- **5+**: Elite - Exceptional mastery (rare, achieved through upgrades)

### Starting Distributions

Each hero begins with a unique stat distribution:

- **Specialists**: High in 1-2 stats, low in others
- **Generalists**: More balanced distribution

### Example Distributions

**Specialist (Invisigal)**:
- Combat 4, Intellect 3, Charisma 1, Mobility 3, Vigor 1
- Excels at combat and speed, weak in social situations and endurance

## Stat Upgrading Strategy

### When to Upgrade

After each level-up, you can allocate points to improve stats. Consider:

1. **Maximize Strengths**: Push strong stats to 5+ for dominance
2. **Shore Up Weaknesses**: Bring weak stats to 2-3 for versatility
3. **Role Specialization**: Build heroes for specific mission types
4. **Team Balance**: Ensure your roster covers all stat needs

### Upgrade Priorities

**Early Game**:
- Focus on each hero's primary stat
- Build 2-3 specialists for common mission types
- Keep at least one balanced generalist

**Mid Game**:
- Develop secondary stats for versatility
- Create specialized builds for specific strategies
- Improve team coverage in weak areas

**Late Game**:
- Maximize key stats to 5+
- Optimize ability synergies
- Perfect team compositions for all scenarios

### Common Mistakes

- **Over-balancing**: Don't try to make every hero good at everything
- **Ignoring Weaknesses**: Some weaknesses need addressing for survivability
- **Following Meta Blindly**: Build for your playstyle and available heroes
- **Neglecting Synergies**: Consider hero abilities when choosing stat upgrades

## Stat-Based Mission Matching

### Reading Mission Requirements

Missions display stat requirements through:
- **Visual Indicators**: Stat bars or icons
- **Mission Tags**: Keywords hinting at needed stats
- **Success Probability**: How well your heroes match

### Optimal Matching

**Perfect Match**: Hero's highest stats align with mission's primary requirements
- Example: Combat 4 hero on villain encounter mission

**Good Match**: Hero has decent stats in required areas
- Example: Combat 3 + Vigor 3 hero on monster attack

**Poor Match**: Hero lacks required stats
- Example: Charisma 1 hero on hostage negotiation

### Multi-Stat Missions

Many missions require 2-3 stats:
- **Deploy Multiple Heroes**: Cover different requirements with different heroes
- **Use Generalists**: Balanced heroes can fill multiple roles
- **Ability Compensation**: Strong abilities can offset stat deficiencies

## Hidden Stat Mechanics

### Stat Thresholds

Some missions have minimum stat requirements:
- Below threshold: Very low success chance
- At threshold: Moderate success chance
- Above threshold: Increased success scaling

### Stat Overlap

The dispatch system uses overlapping stat profiles:
- More overlap = Higher success rate
- Complete mismatch = Likely failure
- Partial overlap = Moderate success

### Diminishing Returns

Stats beyond certain levels provide smaller benefits:
- 0-3: Linear improvement
- 4-5: Good but smaller gains
- 6+: Marginal improvements (rare)

## Stat-Ability Interactions

### Abilities That Modify Stats

Some abilities temporarily boost or modify stats:
- **Prism's Duplication**: Creates copies with half stats
- **Sonar's Transformation**: Swaps Combat/Intellect with Charisma/Vigor
- **Golem's Forms**: Situational stat modifications

### Stat-Scaling Abilities

Certain abilities become stronger with specific stats:
- High Combat = More effective combat abilities
- High Charisma = Better team coordination buffs
- High Intellect = Enhanced hacking abilities

## Conclusion

Mastering the stat system is essential for success in Dispatch. Understanding when each stat matters, how to build your heroes, and how to match them to missions will dramatically improve your success rate and unlock the best endings.

**Key Takeaways**:
- Each stat has specific use cases and mission types
- Build specialists for primary roles and generalists for flexibility
- Match hero strengths to mission requirements
