## Understanding Mission Requirements

### Reading Mission Tags

Each emergency displays specific tags and requirements that hint at needed stats:

**Combat Tags**:
- "Armed Robbery" → Combat + potential Mobility
- "Villain Attack" → Combat + Vigor
- "Monster Threat" → Combat + Vigor + Charisma
- "Physical Confrontation" → Combat

**Intellect Tags**:
- "Hacking Required" → Intellect + Mobility
- "Investigation" → Intellect + Charisma
- "Bomb Disposal" → Intellect + Vigor (steady hands)
- "Technical Emergency" → Intellect

**Charisma Tags**:
- "Hostage Situation" → Charisma + Intellect
- "Crowd Control" → Charisma + Vigor
- "Negotiation" → Charisma
- "Public Relations" → Charisma + Combat (show of strength)

**Mobility Tags**:
- "Chase in Progress" → Mobility + Combat
- "Time Critical" → Mobility
- "Rescue Operation" → Mobility + Vigor
- "Pursuit" → Mobility

**Vigor Tags**:
- "Extended Operation" → Vigor + primary mission stat
- "Dangerous Conditions" → Vigor
- "Endurance Required" → Vigor + Combat/Charisma

### Hidden Requirements

Some missions have unstated requirements:
- **Multi-phase missions**: Require balanced teams
- **Backup needs**: May call for secondary stats mid-mission
- **Environmental factors**: Affect certain hero types

**Strategy**: When uncertain, deploy a balanced team or use heroes with multiple high stats.

## Optimal Hero Selection

### The Match-Making Process

1. **Identify Primary Stat**: What's the main requirement?
2. **Check Secondary Needs**: Are there multiple stat requirements?
3. **Assess Hero Availability**: Who's off cooldown?
4. **Consider Fatigue**: Are available heroes fresh?
5. **Check Relationships**: Do selected heroes work well together?
6. **Verify Success Rate**: Use simulator before deploying

### Single-Hero Deployments

**When to Deploy Solo**:
- Mission clearly needs only one stat
- Invisigal's Wolf Pack XP bonus (solo doubles team XP)
- Hero availability is limited
- Low-risk routine missions

**Best Solo Heroes**:
- **Invisigal**: Combat + Mobility + XP bonus
- **Coupe**: Combat + Intellect + Mobility
- **Malevola**: Intellect + Charisma for non-combat
- **Phenomenon**: Low cooldown for frequent solo runs

**Solo Mission Strategy**:
- Use Invisigal for XP farming
- Deploy specialists to their perfect match missions
- Save multi-hero teams for complex operations

### Two-Hero Deployments

**When to Deploy Pairs**:
- Mission requires two different stats
- Want synergy bonuses from positive relationships
- Need backup for dangerous missions
- Utilizing duplication abilities

**Effective Pairs**:

**Combat + Support**:
- Invisigal + Prism (Combat + Charisma)
- Punch Up + Malevola (Tank + Healing)

**Speed + Power**:
- Coupe + Golem (Mobility + Vigor)
- Invisigal + Punch Up (Speed + Durability)

**Social + Intellect**:
- Prism + Malevola (Charisma + Intellect)
- Sonar + Malevola (Support + Technical)

**Duplication Strategy**:
- Deploy Prism adjacent to highest-stat hero
- Prism slot 2, specialist in slot 1 or 3
- Doubles effective team power

### Three-Hero Deployments

**When to Deploy Trios**:
- High-difficulty missions
- Multiple stat requirements
- Uncertain mission parameters
- Critical story missions

**Balanced Trio Template**:
- **Physical**: High Combat + Vigor (Punch Up, Coupe)
- **Technical**: High Intellect (Malevola)
- **Social**: High Charisma (Prism, Sonar)

**Specialized Trios**:

**Combat Team**:
- Invisigal, Coupe, Punch Up
- Overwhelming combat power with speed and durability

**Technical Team**:
- Malevola, Prism, Invisigal
- Intelligence with social and combat backup

**Endurance Team**:
- Punch Up, Golem, Sonar
- Maximum survivability for extended operations

## Cooldown Management

### Understanding Cooldown Timers

After deployment, heroes enter cooldown periods:
- **Short missions**: 1-2 mission cooldown
- **Standard missions**: 2-3 mission cooldown
- **Extended missions**: 3-5 mission cooldown
- **Phenomenon exception**: 2-second cooldown

### Rotation Strategies

**The Core Rotation (6 Heroes)**:

**Tier 1** (Primary team):
- Invisigal
- Prism
- Malevola

**Tier 2** (Secondary team):
- Punch Up
- Coupe
- Golem/Sonar

**Strategy**: Alternate between tiers, keeping 3 heroes fresh at all times

**The Deep Rotation (8-10 Heroes)**:

For mission-heavy episodes:
- Maintain 3 teams of 2-3 heroes each
- Rotate systematically
- Always have at least one tier available
- Use Phenomenon as flexible gap-filler

### Cooldown Optimization

**Best Practices**:
1. **Track Timers**: Know when heroes become available
2. **Plan Ahead**: Anticipate upcoming mission needs
3. **Don't Overuse Stars**: Rotate even your best heroes
4. **Emergency Reserve**: Keep one strong hero rested for crises
5. **Phenomenon Advantage**: Use low cooldown for frequent deployments

---

## Fatigue Management

### Fatigue Levels

- **0-40% (Fresh)**: Optimal performance, full stats
- **40-70% (Tired)**: -5% to -10% effectiveness
- **70-90% (Exhausted)**: -15% to -25% effectiveness
- **90-100% (Depleted)**: -30%+ effectiveness, high injury risk

### Preventing Fatigue

**Rotation Schedule**:
- **After 1 mission**: Still fresh, can redeploy
- **After 2 missions**: Rest recommended
- **After 3 missions**: Must rest or risk exhaustion
- **After injury**: Mandatory rest period

**Rest Strategies**:
- Rotate after every 2-3 missions
- Keep 6-8 heroes in active rotation
- Use low-fatigue heroes for important missions
- Monitor fatigue levels in hero database

### Fatigue Recovery

**Natural Recovery**: Heroes recover when not deployed
**Accelerated Recovery**:
- Office interactions may boost morale
- Positive story moments can refresh heroes
- Episode transitions reset some fatigue

---

## Team Synergy and Chemistry

### Relationship Bonuses

Heroes with positive relationships (+10 or higher) provide bonuses:
- **+5% to +15% success rate** when deployed together
- **Better coordination** in multi-phase missions
- **Shared experience** boosts leveling
- **Story benefits** unlock special dialogue

### Building Relationships

**Positive Actions**:
- Deploy heroes together frequently
- Succeed at missions as a team
- Choose dialogue options that support team members
- Office interactions that build bonds

**Negative Actions**:
- Failing missions together
- Choosing conflicting dialogue options
- Ignoring hero personal storylines
- Deploying incompatible personalities together

### Optimal Relationship Pairs

**Natural Allies** (Build these relationships):
- Prism + Malevola (Strategic minds)
- Invisigal + Punch Up (Combat specialists)
- Sonar + Malevola (Support synergy)
- Coupe + Golem (Complementary skills)

**Rivalry Management**:
- Some heroes have conflicting personalities
- Avoid pairing rivals unless necessary
- Can sometimes improve rivalries through shared success

## Mission Prioritization

### Simultaneous Emergencies

When multiple missions appear:

**Priority Factors**:
1. **Time Sensitivity**: Timed missions first
2. **Consequence Severity**: Civilian casualties vs property damage
3. **Story Importance**: Main quest vs side missions
4. **Hero Availability**: Can you staff all missions?
5. **Success Probability**: Take missions you can win

### Triage Decision Making

**High Priority**:
- Multiple civilian lives at risk
- Story-critical missions
- Time-limited opportunities
- Missions with cascading failure consequences

**Medium Priority**:
- Standard emergencies
- Property protection
- Routine villain encounters
- Balanced risk/reward missions

**Low Priority**:
- Minor incidents
- Low-risk situations
- Missions with minimal consequences
- Can be handled by single low-tier hero

**When to Accept Failure**:
- Impossible to staff all missions
- Low consequence missions during crisis
- Tactical choice to save heroes for critical upcoming mission

## Advanced Dispatch Tactics

### The Ability Stacking Strategy

**Concept**: Deploy multiple heroes with abilities matching mission tags

**Implementation**:
1. Identify mission tags
2. Select heroes with tag-matching abilities
3. Stack 2-3 matching abilities for massive bonuses

**Example**:
- Mission tag: "Technical + Social"
- Deploy: Malevola (Intellect ability) + Prism (Charisma ability)
- Result: 30-60% success boost from ability synergy

### The Duplication Exploit

**Using Prism's Power**:
1. Deploy highest-stat specialist (Slot 1)
2. Deploy Prism (Slot 2)
3. Prism duplicates specialist with half their stats
4. Effectively 1.5x your best hero

**Optimal Duplication Targets**:
- Combat 6 Invisigal → Creates Combat 3 copy
- Intellect 6 Malevola → Creates Intellect 3 copy
- Charisma 6 Prism → Creates Charisma 3 copy (self-duplication)

### The Immortal Tank Strategy

**Using Punch Up's Invincibility**:
1. Deploy Punch Up to dangerous missions
2. Let Punch Up take damage (gets stronger)
3. Use as emergency responder for high-risk situations
4. Pair with healer for extended operations

**Best Applications**:
- Unknown danger missions
- Monster attacks
- Missions where other heroes might die
- Buying time for main team's cooldown

### The Speed Farm Strategy

**Using Invisigal's Wolf Pack**:
1. Identify easy solo mission
2. Deploy Invisigal alone
3. Complete quickly with high Mobility
4. Earn double XP for entire team
5. Repeat during mission-heavy episodes

**Optimal Farming**:
- Episodes 3-4 (many missions available)
- Low-risk combat missions
- When team needs leveling

### The Phenomenon Spam

**Using 2-Second Cooldown**:
1. Deploy Phenomenon to first mission
2. Immediately available for next mission
3. Handle 3-5 missions while others rest
4. Ideal for mission-heavy sequences

**Best Use Cases**:
- Episode 4 and 6 (many simultaneous missions)
- When primary team is on cooldown
- Lower-difficulty missions
- Filling gaps in rotation
