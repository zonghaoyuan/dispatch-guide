**📝 NOTE**: Specific stat values, ability names, and build recommendations in this guide are based on community gameplay experiences. While the general mechanics are accurate, exact numerical values cannot be verified from official sources.

## Understanding Hero Builds

A hero build refers to how you allocate stat points and develop abilities as your heroes level up. The right build can transform a decent hero into an exceptional one for specific roles and mission types.

## Build Philosophy

### Specialist vs. Generalist

**Specialist Builds**:
- Focus on 1-2 primary stats
- Excel at specific mission types
- Higher success rates in their niche
- Vulnerable when deployed outside specialty

**Generalist Builds**:
- Distribute points across 3-4 stats
- Handle various mission types adequately
- Flexible deployment options
- Lower peak performance but more versatile

**Recommendation**: Build 60% specialists, 40% generalists for optimal roster flexibility.

## Common Build Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Over-Generalizing

**Problem**: Spreading stats too thin across all heroes

**Solution**: Build clear specialists with defined roles

**Example**: Don't try to make Invisigal good at Charisma - embrace her social weakness

### Mistake 2: Neglecting Core Team

**Problem**: Leveling too many heroes equally in early game

**Solution**: Focus on 3-4 core heroes first, then expand

### Mistake 3: Ignoring Abilities

**Problem**: Building stats without considering hero abilities

**Solution**: Build around abilities - e.g., Invisigal's Wolf Pack benefits from solo viability

### Mistake 4: No Backups

**Problem**: Only having one hero per role

**Solution**: Build at least two heroes per primary stat for cooldown rotation

### Mistake 5: Ignoring Team Chemistry

**Problem**: Building heroes who don't work well together

**Solution**: Consider relationship bonuses and team synergies
