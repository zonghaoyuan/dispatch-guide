## Episode Overview

Episode 4 "Restructure" tests your roster management with the highest mission count. You'll face 7-10 missions requiring perfect rotation and strategic prioritization.

---

## Mission Strategy

### The Mission Onslaught

**Total Missions**: 7-10
**Simultaneous Max**: 5-6 at once
**Difficulty**: Requires stats 5+

### Essential Strategy: The Phenomenon Spam

**Phenomenon's Superpower**: 2-second cooldown

**How to Abuse It**:
1. Deploy Phenomenon to easy missions (Combat 4, simple objectives)
2. Immediately available for next mission
3. Can handle 3-5 missions while others rest
4. Use for low-priority missions

**Recommended Phenomenon Deployments**:
- Armed robberies (Combat 4)
- Simple chases (Mobility 3)
- Minor emergencies (any stat 4)

### Rotation Management

**8-Hero Rotation Required**:

**Wave 1** (Primary Team):
- Invisigal, Prism, Malevola
- Deploy to HIGH priority missions

**Wave 2** (Secondary Team):
- Punch Up, Coupe, Golem/Sonar
- Deploy to MEDIUM priority missions

**Wave 3** (Spam Hero):
- Phenomenon
- Deploy to LOW priority missions repeatedly

**Emergency Reserve**:
- Keep one strong hero rested for critical missions

### Priority Triage System

**Tier 1 - Must Complete** (Deploy best team):
- Multiple civilian casualties
- Story-critical missions
- Time-limited events with major consequences

**Tier 2 - Important** (Deploy secondary team):
- Single civilian at risk
- Property damage with casualties
- Standard villain encounters

**Tier 3 - Acceptable Failure** (Phenomenon or accept loss):
- Minor property damage
- Low-risk situations
- No civilians at immediate risk

### Mission Examples

**Mission 1-2**: Standard emergencies (Combat 5, Charisma 4)
**Mission 3-4**: Technical challenges (Intellect 5, Mobility 3)
**Mission 5-7**: The Simultaneous Onslaught (5-6 missions at once)
**Mission 8-10**: Cleanup and resolution

## Story Choices

### Team Structure Decision

**How to organize the Z-Team**

**Option A: Specialized Squads**
- Create 2-3 specialized teams (Combat squad, Tech squad, etc.)
- **Impact**: Better synergy, limited flexibility
- **Best For**: Organized players

**Option B: Flexible Rotation**
- Keep heroes individually deployable
- **Impact**: Maximum flexibility, requires management
- **Best For**: Adaptive players

> **Recommendation**: Flexible Rotation for Episode 4 mission volume

### Interpersonal Conflict

**Team Members Clash**

Heroes will disagree about tactics or personal issues.

**Your Options**:
- **Take Sides**: +10 with chosen hero, -5 with other
- **Neutral Mediation**: +5 with both, shows leadership
- **Ignore It**: No change, potential future tension

> **Recommendation**: Neutral Mediation for team unity

### Resource Prioritization

**Limited Upgrade Resources**

**Choice**: Which heroes to prioritize for upgrades

**Option A: Core 3**
- Focus all resources on Invisigal, Prism, Malevola
- **Result**: 3 dominant heroes, others lag behind
- **Risk**: Cooldown issues if they're exhausted

**Option B**: Balanced Investment**
- Spread resources across 6-8 heroes
- **Result**: Well-rounded roster, no stars
- **Safety**: Always have viable options

> **Recommendation**: Core 3 priority, then spread to others

## XP and Leveling

### Invisigal Wolf Pack Farming

Episode 4 has many missions - perfect for XP farming!

**Strategy**:
1. Deploy Invisigal solo to Combat 5 missions
2. Wolf Pack doubles team XP
3. Can level entire team 2-3 times
4. Farm during "easier" simultaneous missions

### Level Goals

**By End of Episode 4**:
- Core 3 heroes: Level 8-10
- Secondary 3 heroes: Level 6-8
- Phenomenon: Level 5-6
- Reserve heroes: Level 4-5

### Stat Goals

**Primary Stats**:
- Combat specialists: 6+
- Intellect specialists: 6+
- Charisma specialists: 5+
- Vigor tanks: 6+
- Mobility heroes: 5+

## Advanced Tactics

### The Duplication Strategy

**Using Prism's Power**:
1. Deploy highest-stat hero (Slot 1)
2. Deploy Prism (Slot 2)
3. Prism duplicates with half stats
4. Effectively 1.5x your best hero

**Best Targets for Duplication**:
- Invisigal (Combat 6 → creates Combat 3 copy)
- Malevola (Intellect 6 → creates Int 3 copy)

### The Tank and Spank

**For High-Risk Missions**:
1. Deploy Punch Up (cannot die)
2. Deploy Sonar (healing support)
3. Let Punch Up take hits (gets stronger)
4. Guaranteed survival, high success rate

### The Speed Clear

**For Time-Critical Missions**:
1. Invisigal (Mobility 5, Combat 6)
2. Coupe (Mobility 4, Combat 6)
3. Fastest completion times
4. Perfect for time-limited events
